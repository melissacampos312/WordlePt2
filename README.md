# Project 2 - WordlePt2

Submitted by: Melissa Campos Huallanca

WordlePt2 is an app that allows the players to guess a random generated word by giving hints through colored tiles that indicate the correct letters and placement. The app allows you to adjust the number of guesses and letters of the word, choose a theme the word could be, and also a "alien wordle" setting that changes the word after each wrong guess. 

Time spent: 4

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ X] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [ X] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [ X] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [ X] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess
